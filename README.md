# Number-Guesser
This is a beginner interactive number guesser project.

## What it does
- This project allows the user to choose a number between 1 and 9 and then the computer will randomly choose a number in an attempt to guess what the user's number is, if it's a match the computer wins if it's not then the computer loses.
- If a number chosen is higher than 9 or lower than 0 an error message will alert the user and notify the number is undefined or alert them the number isn't allowed.
- There are 3 rounds in total for the computer to guess the number chosen by the user for a fun and interactive game.
